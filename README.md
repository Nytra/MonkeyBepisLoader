A [hookfxr](https://github.com/MonkeyModdingTroop/hookfxr) game wrapper that loads MonkeyLoader and BepInEx into Resonite at the same time.

Some notes: 

- MonkeyLoader pre-patchers don't work.
- It doesn't matter which order you do the first two installation steps.

Installation steps:

1. Install BepisLoader (https://github.com/ResoniteModding/BepisLoader)

2. Install MonkeyLoader + Resonite GamePack (and optionally the RML GamePack) (https://github.com/ResoniteModdingGroup/MonkeyLoader.GamePacks.Resonite)

3. Extract the contents of [MonkeyBepisLoader.zip](https://github.com/ResoniteModdingGroup/MonkeyBepisLoader/releases/latest/download/MonkeyBepisLoader.zip) into the root of your Resonite installation folder and say yes to overwriting any files

4. Start Resonite and enjoy all the mods!

You can get BepInEx mods from the modding discord or from [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/resonite/?section=mods) (currently unlisted and no mod manager support).
